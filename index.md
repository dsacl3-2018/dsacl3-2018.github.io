## Introduction

This the web page of the course
*Data Structures and Algorithms for Computational Lingustics III*
taught at the
[Department of Computational Linguistics](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/ascl.html),
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/).


This programming course provides an introduction to algorithms and data
structures that are commonly used in computational linguistics, such as
string distance measures, data structures for approximate string search,
finite state automata, and parsing algorithms.  The course is driven by
assignments where participants implement these algorithms and data
structures in small, but practical, applications.

### Goals

By the end of the course you will be able to:

  * Write programs to query directed and undirected graphs, such as:
    - Are two vertices connected?
    - What is the shortest path between two vertices?
    - Does a directed graph contain cycles?
  * Implement a spell-checker.
  * Implement a recognizer for finite state grammars.
  * Implement a simple dependency parser.
  * Implement parsing algorithms that are discussed in the *Computational
    Linguistics: Parsing* course.

### GitHub registration

To register, and access to some of the course material,
you need to complete an [introductory assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/w5pfvfix).
Please do this before Wednesday 24th.
