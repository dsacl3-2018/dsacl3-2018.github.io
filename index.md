This programming course provides an introduction to algorithms and data
structures that are commonly used in computational linguistics, such as
string distance measures, data structures for approximate string search,
finite state automata, and parsing algorithms.  The course is driven by
assignments where participants implement these algorithms and data
structures in small, but practical, applications.

### Goals

By the end of the course you can:

  * Write programs to query directed and undirected graphs, such as:
    - Are two vertices connected?
    - What is the shortest path between two vertices?
    - Does a directed graph contain cycles?
  * Implement a small spell-checker.
  * Implement a recognizer for finite state grammars.
  * Implement a simple dependency parser.
  * Implement parsing algorithms that are discussed in the *Computational
    Linguistics: Parsing* course.
